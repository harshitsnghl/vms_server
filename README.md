Managing visitors is one of the major problems faced by the many administrations that deals with visitors’ accommodation. Present system of working by the security management is that the security staff at the guard houses of these student accommodation or premises, visitors come and provide identity proof. Visitor management at the most of the companies right now is manual which consumes a lot of time of the visitors and also this is not very much secure for the any company. From the management point of view, it is difficult to deal with visitors during rush hours with the manual system of working making the visitors to wait in long queues. Management for tracking visitor unit-wise need to check the records manually which consumes a lot of time and might also led to inaccuracy in information collected for such purpose. Some of the problems faced are the difficulty in managing visitors across multiple locations/sites since then, accommodation needs to be controlled all over one specific website within a LAN network in order to manage and secure the individuals visiting IOCL premises, therefore it will also help IOCL to maintain and have over control over visitors and also help secure their employees in case any issue occurs. The Information System Department of Guwahati Refinery is ISO 27001:2013 Certified, as part of security measure it is important to monitor the movement of persons ‘In & Out’ of Department Premise and to track the movement of persons and monitored in a dashboard by Security Admin.
